## Fly Setup

1. [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

2. Sign up and log in to Fly

```sh
fly auth signup
```

## The Database

To get the database started, run this:

```sh
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

When this finishes successfully, it will say:

> All migrations have been successfully applied.

## Build

To run the production build for the app, run the following script:

```sh
npm run build
```

This should take less than a second ⚡

## Development

With your sqlite database setup with tables for your data model via prisma, you're ready to start the dev server. Run this in a new tab in your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

### Relevant code:

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few thing:

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new)

- Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

  ```sh
  fly create indie-stack-template
  fly create indie-stack-template-staging
  ```

- Make sure you have a `FLY_API_TOKEN` added to your GitHub repo, to do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`. Finally you'll need to add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app indie-stack-template
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app indie-stack-template-staging
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/generate-password) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Create a persistent volume for the sqlite database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app indie-stack-template
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app indie-stack-template-staging
  ```

Now that every is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
